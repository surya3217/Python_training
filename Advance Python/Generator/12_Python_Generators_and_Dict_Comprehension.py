"""
Introduce the concept of Iterators & Generators
https://realpython.com/blog/python/introduction-to-python-generators/

In Python, an iterator is an object which implements the iterator protocol. 
The iterator protocol consists of two methods. The __iter__() method, 
which must return the iterator object, and the next() method, 
which returns the next element from a sequence.


Iterators have several advantages:
    Cleaner code
    Iterators can work with infinite sequences
    Iterators save resources

By saving system resources we mean that when working with iterators, 
we can get the next element in a sequence without keeping the entire dataset in memory. 

Python has several built-in objects, which implement the iterator protocol. 
For example lists, tuples, strings, dictionaries or files. 


Normally, if we want to read from a file in Python, we do so one line at a time, as follows:

    for one_line in open(filename):
        print(one_line.rstrip())

    
But sometimes, we want to read more than one line at a time.

For example, suppose a logfile is written in a three-line format. Reading one line at a time is pretty useless, especially if we want to compare a value on line 1 with a value on line 3.

Reading the entire file into a string isn't what we want, either; it might well be too long for us to read the entire thing.  What I really want to do is read three lines at a time.

For this exercise, I want you to write a generator function that takes two arguments â€” the filename from which to read, and the maximum number of lines that should be returned with each iteration.  That is, if our file is

    File line 0 aaa
    File line 1 bbb
    File line 2 ccc
    File line 3 ddd
    File line 4 eee
    File line 5 fff
    File line 6 ggg

Then I could do this:

    for two_lines in read_n(filename, 2):
        print(two_lines.rstrip())
    
And the result would be:

   File line 0 aaa
   File line 1 bbb

   File line 2 ccc
   File line 3 ddd

   File line 4 eee
   File line 5 fff

   File line 6 ggg


Notice that the last line is by itself, because there was an odd number of lines.  We could also say:

    for four_lines in read_n(filename, 4):
        print(four_lines.rstrip())

    
This time we get four lines at a time:

   File line 0 aaa
   File line 1 bbb
   File line 2 ccc
   File line 3 ddd

   File line 4 eee
   File line 5 fff
   File line 6 ggg

With each iteration, read_n should return a string (not a list) containing up to the number of lines specified by the second parameter.

Note that read_n isn't a function that returns a list, but rather a generator function.  In other words, executing read_n will return a generator object -- in other words, an object that implements Python's iteration protocol, and thus knows how to behave inside of a "for" loop or list comprehension.

def read_n(filename, n):
    f = open(filename)

    while True:
        output = ''.join(f.readline()
        for i in range(n))
        if output:
            yield output
        else:
            break

for index, chunk in enumerate(read_n('solution.py', 3)):
    print("{0} '{1}'".format(index, chunk))
